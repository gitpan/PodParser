 TO DO
 =====

 SHORT TERM
 ----------
 * Add the ability to use callbacks _instead_ _of_ inheritance if so
   desired (or mix+match 'em as you wish). This means that there should
   be a way to use callbacks instead of inheritance for the equivalent
   of each of the abstract base class methods that do text processing
   (like preprocess_xxxxx and {begin,end}_xxxx and others). This will go
   into a module named Pod::Callbacks.

 * Add some kind of error-message function which adds file/line info
   to the printed text, and perhaps allow the user to supply their
   own die/croak and warn/carp criteria.

 * IMPROVE PERFORMANCE!!! (its getting kind of slow)

 * Implement -ranges "option" to Pod::Select & podselect

 * Implement more of Pod::Checker

 LONG TERM
 ---------
 * Try and get pod2html and pod2man and the other pod2xxx translators to
   use Pod::Parser (so they will all use the same uniform and consistent
   POD parsing engine).

 * Maybe create a Pod::Compiler class that reads a POD and returns a
   list of Pod::Paragraphs objects?

 * Make changes necessary to accommodate Kenneth Albanowski's Pod::Simplify
   module so that it may use Pod::Parser.

 * Some kind of Pod::ParseUtils would be good for help with parsing of
   the arguments to various commands and interior-sequences (e.g.,
   Nick's Pod::LinkParse). This may overlap with the above regarding
   Ken's Pod::Simplify.

 * See about providing the ability (perhaps via constructor options) to turn
   off certain unwanted Pod::Parser features in order to improve performance
   (things like calling preprocess_xxx() methods and/or some other "virtual"
   member function calls that a subclass might not want to make use of).

 * Try to allow the user to provide a callback function/method which could
   be used in place of the parse_paragraph() method and/or the command(),
   verbatim(), and textblock() methods.  Such a callback might be provided
   as a constructor argument to Pod::Parser.  Perhaps it might be possible
   to pass the callback method an array of lines or of paragraphs (rather
   than one input block at a time) if certain options are specified.
