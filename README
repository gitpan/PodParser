 WHAT IS THIS?
 =============
 This software distribution contains the following packages for using
 Perl5 "pod" (Plain Old Documentation).  See the "perlpod" and "perlsyn"
 manual pages from your Perl5 distribution for more information about pod.

 Pod::Parser
 -----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Parser", which provides a base class for
   parsing and selecting sections of POD documentation from an input
   stream.  Please see the POD documentation for this module (embedded
   in the file "Parser.pm") for more details.

 Pod::Select
 -----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Select", which provides a subclass of
   Pod::Parser and an exported function named "podselect()" to dump
   selected sections of raw pod documentation from an input stream.
   Please see the POD documentation for this module (embedded in the
   file "Select.pm") and Pod::Parser for more details.

 Pod::Usage
 ----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Usage" which provides the function "pod2usage()"
   to print usage messages for a Perl script based on its embedded pod
   documentation. Pod::Usage is a subclass of Pod::PlainText. Please see
   the POD documentation for this module (embedded in the file "Usage.pm")
   for more details. The pod2usage() function is probably the most
   generally useful function in this entire distribution since it is
   useful to just about any Perl5 script that is invoked from the
   command-line.

 Pod::PlainText
 --------------
   A replacement for the Perl5 module "Pod::Text" and the corresponding
   "pod2text()" function. It is derived from the Pod::Parser class.
   Please see the POD documentation for this module and Pod::Parser for
   more details (embedded in the file "PlainText.pm").

   Pod::PlainText *can* peacefully co-exist with the current Pod::Text
   (and pod2text) of your perl distribution. However, IF YOU WANT TO
   PHYSICALLY REPLACE Pod::Text on your system you can do this by making
   the following changes:

      - Replace 'PlainText' with 'Text' in all *.pm and *.PL files in the
        PodParser package (dont forget the 't/' subdirectory).

      - Rename 'PlainText.pm' to 'Text.pm'.

      - You should probably copy the existing Pod::Text and pod2text files
        in your perl distribution to a new name and/or location before
        overwriting them when you perform 'make install'
 
   YOU PROBABLY DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS!!!! Pod::PlainText is not yet
   verified to produce equivalent output to Pod::Text.

 Pod::InputObjects
 -----------------
   Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for advanced users of
   Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name and text.

 Pod::Checker
 ------------
   A module to check the syntax of a POD document. It is just in the
   very beginning stages right now and is *far* from being thorough or
   complete. Its just a starting point that I hope others who plan to
   use it can help me flesh out further.

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 ================
 * Kenneth Albanowski for his extensive assistance with the design and
   interface of Pod::Parser.

 * Steven McDougall for his help and patience with re-writing the manpage
   for Pod::Usage and Pod::Parser.

 * Achim Bonnet for helping me get the regression test-suite into a form
   that works with 'make test' generated by MakeMaker

 * Nick Ing-Simmons, for his considerable time and effort spent trying to
   make pre-release versions of Pod::Parser work with code and giving me
   feedback on the implementation and design.

 CONTENTS
 ========
 Please see the file named "MANIFEST" which should have been included
 in the PodParser distribution.


 REQUIREMENTS
 ============
 * Perl version 5.004 or later (5.005 or later is preferred, but 5.004
   should work as long as you download File::Spec from CPAN)

 * Any version of the File::Spec module from CPAN (note that File::Spec
   is bundled with perl version 5.005 and later)


 BUILDING & INSTALLING
 =====================
 Please see the perl "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" manpage for how to build and
 install using the Makefile.PL template.  In a nutshell, simply typing:

      perl Makefile.PL

 should build a Makefile with the usual targets like "all", "clean",
 "test", and "install".


 BUGS
 ====
 Please send all bug reports to Brad Appleton <bradapp@enteract.com>.


 TO DO
 =====
 Please see the file named "TODO" which should have been included
 in the PodParser distribution.

 HISTORY
 =======
 Please see the file named "CHANGES" which should have been included
