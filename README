 *** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
 ************************

 Version 1.02 of PodParser was NEVER OFFICIALLY RELEASED. A test version
 was uploaded to CPAN and then promptly deleted. Unfortunately, a number
 of ill-behaved CPAN sites have chosen (either deliberately or accidentally)
 to NOT implement CPAN deletions.

 This test version of PodParser-1.02 was very badly broken (IT DOES NOT
 WORK)!  It should never had made it to any of these rogue CPAN sites to
 begin with. IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED PodParser-1.02 DO NOT USE IT. You
 should instead use version 1.03 or else go back to version 1.00.
